		<h1>FAITH STATEMENT</h1>
		<p>
			We firmly believe that salvation, eternal life, and peace in this world
			and the next come exclusively through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. As a
			ministry, we are dedicated to proclaiming the good news of God's grace
			through Jesus Christ, which brings people into His kingdom. As 1 Timothy
			2:3-4 clearly states, "This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants
			everyone to be saved and to understand the truth."
