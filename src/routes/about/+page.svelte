	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>
		Jehovah Shammah ministries international is a faith-based ministry that
		is built on the foundation of Bible based truth with CHRIST JESUS being
		our chief foundation. We have been entrusted with the mandate to bring
		the good news of our LORD JESUS CHRIST and his healing power to the
		hurting world. The Heart felt conviction and burden to share Gods true
		Message of love, healing, restoration and bringing the lost souls into
		God’s kingdom was the foundational call from our Lord Jesus that birthed
		Jehovah Shammah Ministries International in December 2022. Jehovah
		Shammah ministries is uniquely positioned spiritually and qualified to
		fulfill this commission and kingdom need of reconciling the lost souls
		to God through Christ Jesus the Messiah and grounding them in the
		knowledge of truth.

		Jehovah Shammah Ministries international is a voice and a birthplace of
		giving birth to the God given vision and abilities hidden within every soul
		that God predestined to be a part of our ever-growing and effective family.
		We believe in serving as a conduit through which God by His Spirit and by
		the revelation of His eternal word can help bring healing, hope,
		restoration and transformation to our hurting world. God’s dream of
		having all men saved and coming to the knowledge of His truth is our top
		number one priority as our contribution to the Body of Christ as a
		whole.
